an eventbus made on portable MQ.

## Small Roadmap
For Version 3.0. Let's refer https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/choosing-pubsub-or-cloud-tasks

- [x] Refactor the interface, make it clear and more easier to realize.
- [ ] protobuf support for event
- [ ] Metrics support for Prometheus by zap logger
- [ ] Integration for cadence workflow

There are three things stable in computer industry. Storage, Network and OperateSystem.
Sidecar, Or Microservice Orchestration is about the protocl layer. Sidecar would transfer and transport, in order to solve multi complex network problem in real world.
Let's explore new world but not promise communication model, eventbus base on cloud message queue. In QoS 1, it like UDP protocol. With ack, like TCP. With webhook, like service invocation. So eazily scalable on engineering language--Go, and adapted with Hybrid Cloud is my goal.

The most important component is **scheduler**, then the driver.

### smallermap
- [x] Local EventBus (More EventBus)
- [x] WebHook Support
- [x] ACK support
- [ ] 

## Usage
Check the example/pulse and find an example for supported MQ. 
Note: You need run your MQ first and get its address.

### Use MQ as broker
example for natsstreaming.
```go
meta := protocol.NewMetadata()
meta.SetDriver(nats.DriverName)
meta.Properties[nats.NatsURL] = "nats://localhost:4222"
meta.Properties[nats.NatsStreamingClusterID] = "test-cluster"
meta.Properties[nats.SubscriptionType] = "topic"
meta.Properties[nats.ConsumerID] = "app-test-a"

```

### Publisher
Publisher is asynchronously and could get result about the success or failure to send the event.
```go
t, err := topic.NewTopic(meta, topic.WithMiddlewares(visitor.WithRetry(3)))
if err != nil {
    log.Error(err)
    return
}

res := t.Publish(context.Background(), protocol.NewMessage("test", "", []byte("hello")))
go func() {
    if _, err := res.Get(context.Background()); err != nil {
    	log.Error(err)
    }
}()
```

### Subscribe
Receive is a synchronous function and blocks until have an err set by like ctx.Done() or other error.
```go
s, err := subscription.NewSubscription("hello", meta, subscription.WithCount())
if err != nil {
    log.Error(err)
    return
}

err = s.Receive(context.Background(), protocol.NewSubscribeRequest("test", meta), func(ctx context.Context, m *protocol.Message) {
    log.Debug("receive message ", m)
})
```


## **feature**

- Idempotence: Simply record in the map of each Subscription to avoid repeated processing by a single consumer. Nats can provide queueSubscribe

- Orderliness: Messages use OrderingKey to ensure orderly delivery. If an error occurs, the sending of a certain OrderingKey will be suspended, and the empty key will not be suspended

- Concurrent processing: Both topic and Subscription use concurrent processing. Pay attention to whether the middleware has critical resources

- Reliability: ack is implemented independently to ensure that the message is delivered at least once.
    In future: support QoS 0,1,2 three level.
 
- Asynchronous: Message send asynchronously and could be **buffered** and **delay** send. 

- Batch Handle: Scheduler could buffer message and batch handle them if underlying MQ supports.

### **To-DO**
You could find real-time taskboard on https://github.com/silverswords/pulse/projects
- [ ] Refactor the interface, make it clear and more easier to realize.
- [ ] pub/sub system but not a sdk
- [ ] protobuf support for event
- [ ] Metrics support for Prometheus by zap logger?
- [ ] Integration for cadence workflow

## Concepts
### Driver
Driver is the realization of various protocol like Nats, http etc.

### Message Format
Message is the object transport from the pulse endpoint. It's format as CloudEvents.
                
                {
                  "specversion": "1.x-wip",
                  "type": "coolevent",
                  "id": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
                  "source": "bigco.com",
                  "data": { ... }
                }
